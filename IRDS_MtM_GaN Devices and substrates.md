# Difficult Challenges 2019-2025

## 1. GaN-on-Si substrates, large diameter (8”), low defectivity and low cost.

Potential solutions

- New generation of MOCVD reactors allow to scale to 200 mm and 300 mm
- Move from multi-wafer to single wafer reactor concept for 300 mm for better control on temperature profile across the wafer, bow and warp
- Improve substrate quality by growing on non-Si substrates (e.g., poly-AlN) and (potentially) liftoff

Strain engineering
• Growth and processing of wafers thicker than SEMI standard (Si fab 
compatibility to be solved)
• Optimized nucleation, layer-sequence, and growth processes
• Growth on CTE matched substrates (e.g., GaN-on-Si/AlN)
• Alternative approaches: GaN-on-SiC → Quanfine (inexpensive semi-insulating SiC substrates required). DENSO (GaN epi-growth on 4 degree off-axis 4H-SiC without buffer layers by tri-halide vapor phase epitaxy)
• GaN-on-Sapphire

Low defectivity
• Clean Si substrates
• Optimized epi growth (crystal quality, dislocations)
• Epi tool automation
• Improved reactor cleaning processes
• Improved epi wafer cleaning processes
• Better defect detection tools. Binning capability pits vs. particles
• Enabling CL as defect (dislocation) detection tool for production monitoring
• In-line detection and monitoring of Si, C, Mg doping

Low cost
• Increased epi growth speed
• Improved break-down behavior (more V/µm buffer thickness)
• Shortened reactor cleaning processes (e.g., in-situ cleaning)
• Epi tool automation
• Improved tool up-times and reduction of maintenance intervals
• Less monitoring effort due to increased process stability
• Eventually GaN-on-Si in 300 mm (beyond 2025)

## 2.GaN Devices—Low leakage, reliability, avalanche capability

Potential solutions

Low buffer leakage through improved substrate quality
Reduction in gate leakage by Schottky gate engineering or by adopting an alternative regrowth of the gate after recess
Better reliability by improved UID and barrier quality (less defects, better doping control). Improve hot carrier injection by improving quantum well
Low leakage
• Reduced dislocation density in GaN epi
• pGaN devices—gate module engineering, Schottky type vs. ohmic gate 
contact
Reliability, incl. dynamic properties
• Electric field management
• Reduced dislocation and defect density
• Optimized buffer trapping
• Improved passivation processes and materials (e.g., atomic layer deposition)
• Improved GaN purity (in particular in unintentionally doped GaN channel)
• Engineering of hole injection for trapped charge compensation
• Resistivity balance in layer stack
• TCAD model for buffer & device leakage, trapping, detrapping
• For p-GaN gate module—Leakage balance between Schottky diode and pn diode

## 3. GaN MIS—Gate structures

Potential solutions

Achieve a stable gate architecture with limited trapping effects and low leakage jointly to a n-Off behavior by reconstructing the etched GaN surface and choosing the adequate insulator
Reduce Dit at the dielectric interface
Insulator charge control by post-annealing and/or plasma and in-situ doping
Might require regrowth of, e.g., in-situ SiN or AlN and subsequent ALD

• Atomic layer etching for gate recess etching, atomic layer deposition for gate dielectric
• Possibly fundamental limitation due to separation of 2DEG channel and trapping interface by barrier hindering rapid charge exchange during switching
• Invention/development of appropriate gate dielectric required, which prevents positive charge incorporation during positive gate biasing

## 4.GaN Devices—Regrown ohmic contacts

Potential solutions

Today ohmic contact resistance is ~0.1 Ω.mm with a standard Ti/Al metal stack, which is sufficient for power devices
Silicon doping for n ohmic contacts
High temperature ion implantation techniques in combination with high temperature pulse activation need to be investigated

## 5.GaN Devices—On-Chip Integration 

pMOS device that is compatible with the standard HEMT process flow
Creation of a 2DHG based devices. Some studies showing the potentiality of AlN/GaN Barrier to create such a channel

## 6.GaN modules 

Parallellization of several GaN die in a module
Co-integration of the driver (and controller ?)
Simulation approach to optimize parasitic inductance (“digital twin”)
Monolithic GaN driver integration wherever necessary and of advantage. This needs to be aligned with the hybrid GaN die integration capabilities.

## 7.High power switching of GaN devices with high reliability

Epi without trapping effects to decrease hot electrons tapping during Hard Switching operation which limits the SSOA of commercially available devices

## 8.GaN Multi MHz operation @ 100 W and more

- Deep-acceptor doping
Heterostructures

## 15.Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes 

Enhancement of breakdown voltage with keeping a reasonable on-resistance
Reliability and endurance test
